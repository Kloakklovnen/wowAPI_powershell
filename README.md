# wowAPI_powershell
a basic script to test connectivity and URLs for the Blizzard APIs

This script was originally meant to be an Azure function, and will most likely be in the future. 
For now it's just a debugging script to make sure the creation and refreshing of tokens is working and geting familiar with the API url and request.
Also, while there are other scripts/apps doing the same, and being promoted on the Blizzard API forum. I found no Powershell script
laying around for this purpose, being this easy to get up and running. Eyes of the beholder and shit, I know.
